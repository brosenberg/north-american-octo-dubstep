USAGE

convert.pl -i INPUT_DIR -o OUTPUT_DIR -t TEMPLATE_FILE

Converts .convert files in INPUT_DIR and writes them to OUTPUT_DIR, preserving
the directory structure. Uses TEMPLATE_FILE as the basis of the output files.

The resulting files are html, assuming a proper template file.


.convert SYNTAX

If a line is to be converted, it will begin with a specific tag. Currently there
are three types of tags:

=T=
    This sets the <title> to the rest of the text on the line, and also wraps that line in <h1> tags.

=#=
    Where # is any number. This wraps the line in <h#+1> tags.

=R=
    The =R= tag is dropped and the rest of the line is added as raw HTML

All lines that do not begin with a tag are wrapped in <p> tags.


template SYNTAX

Only two things are converted in the template. The line beginning with <!-- ##TITLE --> is replaced with the title. And the line beginning with <!-- ##BODY --> is filled with the converted html from the .convert file. Whatever indentation the <!-- ##BODY --> line has will be preserved for all of the .convert contents.
